# BB sorter

Quick and dirty Arduino project to control a servo motor using a light sensor, so different colored BB's are sorted (pushed to the left or the right).

> This is a quick and dirty project. Yes, code structure and implementation could be a lot better. Yes, there would be a more efficient way. No, I did not care as this is one time and rapid-development project (one evening to be exact). So please be aware when copying any code as it could be improved a lot.
